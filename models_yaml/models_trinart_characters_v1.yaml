  description: trinart_characters_19.2m_stable_diffusion_v1 is a stable diffusion v1-based model trained by roughly 19.2M anime/manga style images (pre-rolled augmented images included) plus final finetuning by about 50,000 images. This model seeks for a sweet spot between artistic style versatility and anatomical quality within the given model spec of SDv1
